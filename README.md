## Thanks

* To bertvv for his bind ansible role for authoritative DNS with nice jinja2 filters to handle reverse lookup
https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-role-bind
In the end, there is an existing filter to do that since 1.9 ```ipaddr('revdns')```
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_filters_ipaddr.html
One limitation, it's for not fit for zone and as such IPv6 is untested/unsupported.
